                "   - Combines firewall, antivirus, content filtering, and IDS/IPS into one appliance.\n"
                "   - Ideal for small teams without a dedicated security team.\n"
                "2. **VPN-enabled router with VLAN segmentation**\n"
                "   - Enables secure remote access for employees.\n"
                "   - VLANs help separate traffic (e.g., guest vs internal).\n"
                "3. **Secure Wi-Fi with WPA3 and MAC filtering**\n"
                "   - WPA3 offers the latest encryption standards for wireless security.\n"
                "   - MAC filtering ensures only known devices connect.\n"

                "   - Allows secure traffic between branch and headquarters.\n"
                "   - Typically uses IPsec tunnels with static IP configuration.\n"
                "5. **Cloud-managed switch (Layer 2 or 3)**\n"
                "   - Provides centralized visibility and control via a web console.\n"
                "   - Layer 3 switching can also handle routing if needed."

                "   - Verifies user identity and endpoint compliance before granting access.\n"
                "   - Can integrate with AD, RADIUS, or 802.1X.\n"
                "4. **Firewalls between internal zones and internet edge**\n"
                "   - Implements security segmentation (e.g., HR zone, Finance zone).\n"
                "   - Controls East-West and North-South traffic.\n"
                "5. **SD-WAN for Branch Site Integration**\n"
                "   - Offers better performance and flexibility over traditional MPLS.\n"
                "   - Centralized controller can define traffic policies."

                "   - ExpressRoute provides private connection with low latency.\n"
                "2. **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture for Segmentation**\n"
                "   - Central hub VNet manages connectivity and security.\n"
                "   - Spoke VNets for specific workloads (e.g., dev, prod).\n"
                "3. **Use NSGs and Azure Firewall for Traffic Control**\n"
                "   - NSGs manage traffic rules at subnet or NIC level.\n"
                "   - Azure Firewall inspects and logs network traffic.\n"
                "4. **Enforce Routing Tables and DNS Forwarding**\n"
                "   - Custom route tables help control traffic flow between subnets.\n"
                "   - Forward DNS requests to on-prem DNS if hybrid.\n"
                "5. **Integrate with On-Prem AD/LDAP Securely**\n"
                "   - Use Azure AD Connect with password hash sync or pass-through auth.\n"
                "   - Deploy AD DS in Azure if full hybrid is needed."
